PySBS: Stimulated Brillouin scattering simulations in Python
============================================================



Introduction
------------

PySBS provide a set of easy to use tools for simulations of Brillouin scattering in waveguides. The core of the program is an elastic mode which is fully tensorial and enables simulation of anisotropic materials. The solver is coupled with an electromagnetic mode solver to calculate the Brillouin gain.

Installation
------------

PySBS  requires Python 3 and FEniCS. The full documentation for the later is provided at <https://fenicsproject.org>. It can be installed using pip ::

    pip3 install fenics-ffc --upgrade


PySBS has been written and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. The recommended IDE for python 3 is Spyder3 whose GUI is similar to matlab.



PySBS installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the latest version of PySBS from github and install it via ::

    python setup.py install

Or, if you wish to edit the source code without re-installing each time ::

    python setup.py develop



Example of use
--------------
The files are located in the examples directory. The documented examples include:
    - Caclulating electromagnetic and elastic modes for silicon waveguide
    - Calculating the elastic and electromagnetic modes of chalcogenide waveguides
    - TODO: document gain calculations currently in the gain directory
